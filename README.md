# PSR-simulation

This is a program I wrote from scratch in my time as a research Intern at the Technion Institute of Techonology between 07/2021-09/2021.
Given a set of intial conditions for a perfectly stirred ramjet engine, this program simulates the conditions of the corresponding
combustion reaction and outputs the reactions, residence time, flow time, Damkohler number, and equivalence ratio.
